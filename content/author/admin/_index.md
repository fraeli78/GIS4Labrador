I have worked with a lot of the modern technologies that are used in GIS, WebGIS, Database handling, and Python to name a few. In addition, I help manage several data, elaborating statistical reports. Furthermore, I had the pleasure of working for public and private companies, as well as a one-year contract in university research.

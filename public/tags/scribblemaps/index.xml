      <description>Assume that for some reason you need to create some worldwide thematic maps. The maps should contain the national borders, main cities, main communication routes, rivers and lakes. Let us suppose you have a short time to finish the job and you have absolutely nothing at all in your archive. In other words, we have to solve this problem by using only information available on Geospatial Data Portals such as Natural Earth, NASA Earth Observations, The FAO GeoNetwork…, and so on.</description>

      <description>Since Google Maps released the API in 2005 Web maps became popular after giving web developers an easy way to drop custom apps in their sites with a minimal amount of new code.
Today’s Web maps are known as “slippy maps”. The user can freely pan and zoom in the map with fluid motions. The interface uses Ajax to dynamically load new portions of the map as needed without reloading the whole page.</description>
